Color themes for the PuTTY ssh terminal emulator for Windows.

Run make.
Copy the resulting .reg file to your Windows machine.
Load the .reg file into your local registry.
The easiest way to do that is just double-click it in the finder.

If you want to change a PuTTY session that already exists:

Open the .reg file in a text editor, 
Replace Default%20Settings with the PuTTY session name you would like to modify.
Load the modified .reg file into your local registry.
