Slack Client Sidebar Theme

Unfortunately, only the sidebar is can be themed. The only options for the
central and right column are to select a standard Light, standard Dark, or
switch with the OS.  But the Dark and the Light look ok with Lunaria.

Run make, then cat out light.txt, dark.txt, or eclipse.txt and then
paste into the Slack client according to the directions.
