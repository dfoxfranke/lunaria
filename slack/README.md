Slack Client Sidebar

Unfortunately, in the official Slack client, only the sidebar and
title area can be themed. The only color theme options for the central
and right column are to a predefined Light, predefined Dark, or
switch with the OS.  But the Dark and the Light do look ok with
Lunaria Dark and Lunaria Light.

Run make, then cat light.txt, dark.txt, or eclipse.txt and then follow
the directions in the generated .txt file.
