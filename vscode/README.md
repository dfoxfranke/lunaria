# Lunaria

Lunaria is a fam­ily of sooth­ing, moderate-​contrast color
palettes. Lu­naria's col­ors were gen­er­ated al­go­rith­mi­cally,
em­ploy­ing the cut­ting edge of color sci­ence: the CAM16 color
ap­pear­ance model and its as­so­ci­ated uni­form color space and
chro­matic adap­ta­tion trans­form.

Lu­naria in­cludes three dis­tinct palettes:

* The *Light* palette is for users who pre­fer to read dark text on
  a light back­ground. It is de­signed to pro­vide the best
  fac­sim­ile of ink-​on-paper that an LCD mon­i­tor can pos­si­bly
  achieve. Its col­ors are op­ti­mized for view­ing in the bright
  window-​lit con­di­tions typ­i­cal of 21st cen­tury of­fice
  build­ings, but hold up well in a broad range of con­di­tions.

* The *Dark* palette is for users who pre­fer light text on a dark
  back­ground. Its neu­tral col­ors are de­signed to give an
  im­pres­sion of a moon­lit night and are de­rived from ac­tual
  spec­tral data col­lected from the Fred Lawrence Whip­ple
  moun­tain­top as­tro­nom­i­cal ob­ser­va­tory. It is op­ti­mized
  for night­time view­ing under dim, warm LED il­lu­mi­na­tion.

* The *Eclipse* palette is al­most iden­ti­cal to the Dark palette,
  but op­ti­mized for the same brighter view­ing con­di­tions as the
  Light palette is. The most vis­i­ble dif­fer­ence is that the
  back­ground is darker as a re­sult of com­pen­sat­ing for
  in­creased view­ing flare (am­bi­ent light re­flected off the
  mon­i­tor sur­face).
